      interactive experiences and a community engaged

      your agency to other companies; we help you to take back
      agency over your own brain.</p>

    <h1>Join our Team!</h1>
    <p>We are looking for creative, ambitious people who are willing to take risks at the forefront of
      democratized technology.</p>

    <h1>Our Mythology</h1>
    <p>Neurotechnology is inevitable, empowering, and a siren song that many cannot ignore.
      We must reclaim agency over our brainsâ€”because, sadly, we don't have agency over them any longer.</p>
