    <h1>Join our Team!</h1>
    <p>We are looking for creative, ambitious people who are willing to take risks at the forefront of
      democratized technology.</p>

    <h1>Our Mythology</h1>
    <p>Neurotechnology is inevitable, empowering, and a siren song that many cannot ignore.
      We must reclaim agency over our brainsâ€”because, sadly, we don't have agency over our own.</p>
