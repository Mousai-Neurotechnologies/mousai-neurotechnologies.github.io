    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h3>Human-Centered Design in Commercial Neurotechnology</h3>
    <p>Mousai Neurotechnologies is a design studio that enables and 
      empowers marginalized, non-expert stakeholders to participate in 
      neurotechnology UX design.</p>

    <p>During our launch years, we will (1) create interactive visualizations 
      for memory neurotechnologies, (2) a web plugin to annotate existing 
      neurotechnology and visualize patterns of feedback, and (3) a 
      speculative social platform for the OpenBCI headset.</p>
