        <h3>Livewire: A Stimulating Night of Neurotechnology</h3>
        <p>Livewire is an immersive entertainment event in March 5th, 2021.</p>

        <h3>#BCIGameJam</h3>
        <p>#BCIGameJam is a speculative design workshop hosted by Dimitris Grammenos
            at the University of Southern California.</p>

        <h3>Invocations</h3>
        <p>Invocations is Mousai's monthly newsletter.</p>

        <h3>Brainstorm</h3>
        <p>Brainstorm is a social neurotechnology platform that
            enables you to manage your brain data on the web and
            couple with other minds across social, cultural, and political boundaries.</p>

        <h3>Hippocampal Memory Prosthesis (HMP)</h3>
        <p>The HMP is a proof-of-concept system that
            delivers precise patterns of electrical stimulation
            to the brains of human epilepsy patients and
            significantly improves memory formation.</p>
        <p>We are collaborating with the USC Center for Neural
            Engineering and the neuroethics thrust at the UW Center
            for Neurotechnology to incorporate user feedback into the
            future design of memory neurotechnologiesâ€”including the HMP.</p>
