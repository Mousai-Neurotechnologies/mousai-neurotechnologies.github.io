    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h3>Human-Centered Neurotechnology Design</h3>
    <p>Since 2020, Mousai Neurotechnologies has enabled some of the world's top neurotechnology
        companies to empower non-expert stakeholders to participate in technology design.</p>
    <p><strong>Services: </strong>Transformative,
        interactive experiences and a community engaged
        with participatory (design of) media. We don't sell
        your agency to other companies; we help you to take back
        agency over your own brain.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Product R&D: We research, design, and build digital tools that make people's lives easier</li>
        <li>Digital Design & Development: We create transformative digital experiences, optimized for later product development</li>
        <li>Content & Production: We make compelling content from our in-house studio</li>
        <li>Strategy: Consulting, planning, and research</li>
        <li>Design: UX, photography, and visual arts</li>
        <li>Technology: Engineering, data, and systems design</li>
        <li>Advertising: Promotional, PR, and marketing</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Organizational Structure: </strong>???</p>
    <p><strong>Business Model: </strong>Project-based cost structure</p>
    <p><strong>Values: </strong>Ethics and honesty, social responsibility, innovation and creativity, commitment to employees</p>
    <p><strong>Customers: </strong>We serve neurotechnology companies.
        We embed in their operation. We validate our designs from the bottom-up</p>
    <p><strong>Growth Strategy: </strong>???</p>

    <h1>Join our Team!</h1>
    <p>We are looking for creative, ambitious people who are willing to take risks at the forefront of
        democratized technology.</p>

    <h1>Our Mythology</h1>
    <p>Neurotechnology is inevitable, empowering, and a siren song that many cannot ignore.
        We must reclaim agency over our brainsâ€”because, sadly, we don't have agency over our own.</p>
