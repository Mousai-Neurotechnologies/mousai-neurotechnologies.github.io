    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <h3>Livewire: A Stimulating Night of Neurotechnology</h3>
    <p>Livewire is an immersive entertainment event in March 5th, 2021.</p>

    <h3>#BCIGameJam</h3>
    <p>#BCIGameJam is a speculative design workshop hosted by Dimitris Grammenos
        at the University of Southern California.</p>

    <h3>Invocations</h3>
    <p>Invocations is Mousai's monthly newsletter.</p>

    <h3>Brainstorm</h3>
    <p>Brainstorm is a social neurotechnology platform that
        enables you to manage your brain data on the web and
        couple with other minds across social, cultural, and political boundaries.</p>

    <h3>Hippocampal Memory Prosthesis (HMP)</h3>
    <p>The HMP is a proof-of-concept system that
        delivers precise patterns of electrical stimulation
        to the brains of human epilepsy patients and
        significantly improves memory formation.</p>
    <p>We are collaborating with the USC Center for Neural
        Engineering and the neuroethics thrust at the UW Center
        for Neurotechnology to incorporate user feedback into the
        future design of memory neurotechnologiesâ€”including the HMP.</p>
